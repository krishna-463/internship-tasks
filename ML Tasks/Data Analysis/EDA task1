Exploratory Data Analysis is very important to get insights on data given to you it posses several steps.
step-1:
      Problem Understanding : It need business approach to understand the problem
step-2:
      import the data
step-3:
      1. Univariate analysis:
        Distribution --> distplot or histplot
        Frequency --> countplot
        Outliers --> boxplot
      2. Bivariate analysis: (after understanding the problem if it is supervised learning then we can sense the target variable)
        Correlation --> df.corr() Heatmaps
        Comparision of categorical Features --> histograms with hue = target column
step-4:
      Data preparation:
       Handling missing values
       removing outliers
       data type conversions
step-5:
     Data Preprocessing:
      Feature Engineering --> Converting categorical columns to numerical
      Data Normalization
step-6:
      Data Modeling
      Getting insights after abserving all the above things
